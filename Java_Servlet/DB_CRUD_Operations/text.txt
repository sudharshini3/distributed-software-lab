Goal:
Implement a servlet that interacts with a database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations for a stock management system.
Steps:
1. Set up a database with a table named stock (fields: id, product_name, quantity).
2. Create a simple web form to interact with the database (add, update, delete products).
3. Create a Servlet (StockManagementServlet) that handles database operations.

Database Setup (MySQL example):
CREATE DATABASE stock_management;
USE stock_management;
CREATE TABLE stock (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
product_name VARCHAR(255),
quantity INT
);
